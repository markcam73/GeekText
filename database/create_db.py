That dream was cut short by her fantastically unbalanced father and a morbidly eccentric childhood.

For every intellectual misfit who thought they were the only ones to think the things that Lawson dares to say out loud, this is a poignant and hysterical look at the dark, disturbing, yet wonderful moments of our lives.
